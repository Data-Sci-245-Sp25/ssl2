    "text": "The charts above display the top three causes of cancer-related deaths per 100,000 people from 2014 to 2023 across four racial and ethnic groups in Multnomah County: White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations. Lung cancer consistently emerges as the leading cause of cancer mortality across all groups, accounting for over half of all top cancer deaths in each demographic. For White and Hispanic populations, Pancreatic cancer follows, while Liver and Prostate cancers are more prominent among Black individuals. Among Asians, Liver and Pancreatic cancers round out the top three. These charts highlight both the commonality of lung cancer as a critical health issue and the variation in secondary cancer burdens, suggesting a need for tailored public health strategies across communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line graph presents lung cancer death rates per 100,000 individuals across four racial and ethnic groups in Multnomah County from 2014 to 2023. The White population shows a significantly higher death rate throughout the period, with a sharp spike in 2015 followed by a gradual decline. Black, Asian, and Hispanic populations maintain relatively low and stable rates, with the Hispanic group consistently showing the lowest mortality. However, this visualization should be interpreted with caution. The data is skewed due to population size differences—there is a much larger White population in the county, which naturally results in more recorded deaths. As such, while the graph gives a sense of trend over time, it is not the most effective for making direct comparisons across racial groups without adjusting for population proportion or using standardized visualization methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph highlights the lung cancer death rates per 100,000 for the Asian, Black, and Hispanic populations in Multnomah County from 2014 to 2023. By excluding the White population, which had significantly higher death rates, the visualization allows for a clearer comparison among these three groups. The data reveals that the Black population experienced the highest lung cancer mortality across most years, peaking in 2016. The Hispanic group generally follows, with fluctuating but elevated rates, while the Asian population consistently shows the lowest death rates throughout the decade. This refined visualization offers a more focused view of disparities that were previously overshadowed, enabling more accurate insights into the health outcomes of communities of color. However, even in this version, it’s important to acknowledge that variations in population size and access to diagnosis may still influence reported rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph illustrates the lung cancer death rate per 100,000 individuals among White populations in Multnomah County between 2014 and 2023. The data reveals a dramatic spike in 2015, with rates peaking above 320 deaths per 100,000—by far the highest across all racial groups studied. While the rate decreases in subsequent years, it remains significantly elevated compared to other groups, fluctuating between 130 and 230 per 100,000. This persistent disparity may reflect a combination of higher population numbers, historical smoking rates, and age distribution within the White population. The declining trend in recent years may suggest some progress in prevention or treatment, but the overall burden remains substantial and warrants sustained public health attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization shows lung cancer death rates per 100,000 individuals from 2014 to 2023, broken down by race: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White populations. By separating each group into its own panel, the graph allows for a clearer comparison of trends without one group visually dominating due to scale. The White population stands out with consistently higher death rates, peaking sharply in 2015 above 300 deaths per 100,000 and gradually declining afterward. In contrast, Black and Asian populations show mid-range rates with notable year-to-year fluctuations, particularly a spike for Black individuals in 2017. Hispanic populations consistently report the lowest rates, though their trend line also varies across years. This format highlights disparities while maintaining equal visual weight for each racial group, making it easier to detect patterns that could inform targeted interventions.",

By identifying patterns and disparities in cancer mortality, this study seeks to understand how structural inequalities, such as access to healthcare and historical discrimination, may contribute to unequal health outcomes. We have centered our core variables to race and ethnicity to be able to move beyond surface-level data and instead focus on the lived experiences of communities that have often been excluded from dominant health narratives. Ultimately, this research aims to inform more inclusive public health strategies and contribute to ongoing efforts toward health equity and justice.",

    "text": "This project analyzes cancer mortality data from Multnomah County, focusing on how the top three causes of cancer-related deaths have varied across racial and ethnic groups over the past ten years. Race and ethnicity were selected as key variables due to their deep connections with structural factors such as geographic location, access to care, and economic status. Historically, communities of color in Multnomah County have been disproportionately impacted by health inequities stemming from systemic discrimination. By centering these populations in our analysis, this research aims to bring visibility to patterns of disparity that are often underrepresented in public health data. The findings from this study are intended to support the Multnomah County Health Department in developing more informed, equitable, and community-responsive health policies moving forward.",

    "text": "Key takeaways:\n\nCancer is a leading cause of death in the U.S., but progress in reducing mortality has not been equally shared across racial and ethnic groups.\nRacial disparities in cancer outcomes are shaped by systemic inequities such as structural racism, unequal healthcare access, and socioeconomic barriers.\nBlack Americans face the highest cancer mortality rates nationally, especially in prostate and colorectal cancers.\nNative American and Alaska Native populations have rising cancer death rates, often worsened by geographic isolation and limited access to culturally appropriate care.\nLocal-level data, like that of Multnomah County, is critical to uncovering place-based disparities and designing targeted public health responses.\n\nCancer remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with significant disparities in outcomes across racial and ethnic groups (CDC 2023). Although overall cancer mortality has declined since the early 2000s, these improvements have not been equally shared, revealing a public health equity challenge.\nThese disparities are rooted in structural racism and shaped by a range of socioeconomic and environmental factors—such as unequal access to timely care, differences in insurance coverage, and varying exposure to risk factors (Jack and Mitchell 2023). Historical patterns of discrimination continue to impact cancer screening rates, stage at diagnosis, treatment access, and survival outcomes.\nBlack Americans experience the highest overall cancer mortality rates among all racial and ethnic groups, especially in prostate and colorectal cancers (CDC 2025). For example, Black men face a prostate cancer death rate nearly twice that of white men, despite having similar incidence rates—highlighting critical inequities in detection, treatment, and care quality.\nNative American and Alaska Native populations have seen rising mortality rates for several cancer types, including lung, colorectal, liver, stomach, and kidney cancers (Jack and Mitchell). Geographic isolation, underfunded healthcare systems, and a lack of culturally responsive cancer care further exacerbate these outcomes.\nPlace-based disparities intersect with racial and ethnic inequities in complex ways. Understanding local-level patterns is essential to developing effective, targeted public health interventions.\nDespite growing awareness of the links between cancer and racial disparities, public health literature remains limited in its exploration of these issues at the county level. This research seeks to address that gap by examining the relationship between race/ethnicity and cancer-related deaths in Multnomah County, Oregon.\nNotably, while cancer incidence among non-Hispanic white populations has increased nationally, this trend does not directly correspond to mortality rates. So, just knowing how many people get cancer isn’t enough — we need to look separately at how many actually die from it, and break that down by race and location to understand the full picture.\n\n\n\nGraph from the CDC’s “History of Cancer” page\n\n\nThis study aims to uncover persistent gaps in cancer outcomes across racial and ethnic groups in Multnomah County. By focusing on localized data, the research provides actionable insights for healthcare providers, policymakers, and community organizations working to advance cancer health equity.",

Free nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), local public health ads.\nEarly detection saves lives. Offer low-dose CT scan lung cancer screening at low or no cost. Partner with primary care clinics, community health centers.\nAwareness gaps differ by community. Launch culturally sensitive public education efforts about lung cancer symptoms, risk factors (like radon exposure, occupational hazards). Use multilingual materials, trusted local organizations, and radio/social media tailored to each group.\nExposure to pollutants can increase lung cancer risk too (not just smoking). Strengthen policies around workplace safety for hazard protection.\nDisparities in healthcare access worsen outcomes. Expand Medicaid coverage and community clinic funding for lung health screenings and treatment access in low-income areas.",
