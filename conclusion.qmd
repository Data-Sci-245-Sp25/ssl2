- Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death across all racial and ethnic groups in Multnomah County over the past decade.

- White populations experience significantly higher lung cancer death rates than all other groups, peaking at over 300 deaths per 100,000 in 2015.

- Black individuals show the second-highest mortality rates, with substantial fluctuations and a notable spike in 2017.

- Hispanic and Asian populations consistently show lower death rates, although they still face year-to-year variation and should not be overlooked.

- The top three cancer types differ across racial/ethnic groups: for example, liver and prostate cancer rank high among Black individuals, while pancreatic cancer is more prevalent among White and Hispanic populations.

- Disparities are influenced by structural inequities such as access to care, geographic isolation, and culturally appropriate services.

- Removing White population data in comparative graphs reveals hidden trends and disparities among other racial groups that were previously masked by scale.
