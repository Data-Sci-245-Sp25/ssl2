The aim of this research is to investigate how the top three types of cancer-related deaths have varied across different racial and ethnic groups in Multnomah County over the past ten years. By identifying patterns and disparities in cancer mortality, this study seeks to understand how structural inequalities, such as access to healthcare and historical discrimination, may contribute to unequal health outcomes. We have centered our core variables to race and ethnicity to be able to move beyond surface-level data and instead focus on the lived experiences of communities that have often been excluded from dominant health narratives. Ultimately, this research aims to inform more inclusive public health strategies and contribute to ongoing efforts toward health equity and justice.
