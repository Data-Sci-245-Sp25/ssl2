Are certain types of cancer more prevalent or deadly in specific racial or ethnic populations?

What are the trends in cancer mortality over the past decade across these groups??

What are the top 3, in 1 yr look at various races.

Figuring out the top 3 overall, if there is a large grp of white alone (bc there are more white people) will skew the data

Lung, breast, pancreatic is the top 3 for aggregated data

How does this look in diff races? but everyone has there own top 3?
