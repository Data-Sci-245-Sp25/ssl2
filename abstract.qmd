This project analyzes cancer mortality data from Multnomah County, focusing on how the top three causes of cancer-related deaths have varied across racial and ethnic groups over the past ten years. Race and ethnicity were selected as key variables due to their deep connections with structural factors such as geographic location, access to care, and economic status. Historically, communities of color in Multnomah County have been disproportionately impacted by health inequities stemming from systemic discrimination. By centering these populations in our analysis, this research aims to bring visibility to patterns of disparity that are often underrepresented in public health data. The findings from this study are intended to support the Multnomah County Health Department in developing more informed, equitable, and community-responsive health policies moving forward.
