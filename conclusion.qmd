- Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death across all racial and ethnic groups in Multnomah County over the past decade.

- White populations experience significantly higher lung cancer death rates than all other groups, peaking at over 300 deaths per 100,000 in 2015.

- Black individuals show the second-highest mortality rates, with substantial fluctuations and a notable spike in 2017.

- Hispanic and Asian populations consistently show lower death rates, although they still face year-to-year variation and should not be overlooked.

- The top three cancer types differ across racial/ethnic groups: for example, liver and prostate cancer rank high among Black individuals, while pancreatic cancer is more prevalent among White and Hispanic populations.

- Disparities are influenced by structural inequities such as access to care, geographic isolation, and culturally appropriate services.

- Removing White population data in comparative graphs reveals hidden trends and disparities among other racial groups that were previously masked by scale.

1. Lung cancer is strongly linked to smoking history. Free nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), local public health ads.

2. Early detection saves lives. Offer low-dose CT scan lung cancer screening at low or no cost. Partner with primary care clinics, community health centers.

3. Awareness gaps differ by community. Launch culturally sensitive public education efforts about lung cancer symptoms, risk factors (like radon exposure, occupational hazards). Use multilingual materials, trusted local organizations, and radio/social media tailored to each group.

4. Exposure to pollutants can increase lung cancer risk too (not just smoking). Strengthen policies around workplace safety for hazard protection. 

5. Disparities in healthcare access worsen outcomes. Expand Medicaid coverage and community clinic funding for lung health screenings and treatment access in low-income areas.
