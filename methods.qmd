The data used in this analysis is aggregated from individual cancer death cases in Multnomah County over the last 10 years.

The decedents included in the data utilized for this study are those who have cancer listed as their cause of death, determined by a physician.

The race and ethnicity of the decedent are determined by their vital record, which is most often self-reported and thus subject to possible under-reporting. The racial and ethnic categories coded by the current REALD system provide a certain level of granularity, while record-keeping systems such as REALD+ aim to increase race & ethnicity specifications. Thus, because this research was conducted at a time when REALD is the primary record-keeping system, this research only includes the following categories:

-   American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic

-   Asian, non-Hispanic

-   Black, non-Hispanic

-   Hispanic/Latinx

-   Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic

-   White, non-Hispanic

-   Two or more non-Hispanic races
